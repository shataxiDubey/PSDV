We proposed ConfMix, a novel confidence-based mixing method for adapting object detectors trained on a source
domain to a target domain in an unsupervised manner. We
introduced a region-level strategy for sample data augmentation by mixing the region of the target image with the most
confident pseudo detections with the source image, and
achieved adaptation with a consistency loss on the pseudo
detections. We also introduced the progressive pseudo labelling scheme by gradually restricting the confidence metric in order to facilitate the smooth transition from learning
the target representation to improving detection accuracy.
We compared our approach with state-of-the-art methods,
demonstrating its superior performance on two benchmarks.
As future work, we will apply our method in other practical
scenarios, other than autonomous driving, and improve its
compatibility with different object detection frameworks.
